    <h1>📝 day notes</h1>
    <p>a simple notes app</p>

    <i>currently in progress, app coming soon</i>

    <h2>about</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>☯️ no manual organization needed, just start writing</li>
      <li>📖 read notes as a reverse chronological feed</li>
      <li>⚡️ fast, small, and works well on all devices</li>
      <li>💾 persists notes to your browser's local storage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>why</h2>
    <p>
      i wanted a simpler notes solution that was tailored to my personal
      workflow.
    </p>

    <h2>demo</h2>
    <div class="demo-container">
      <App client:load demo={true} />
    </div>

    <h2>plans</h2>
    <p>
      a feature i really want is cross-device sync. unfortunately, this will
      require some kind of account based auth stuff. maybe i'll just use
      something like github gists' API, or maybe i'll do something more custom.
      i'm not sure on the details yet. though i definitely want the app to be
      offline-first so it works even without an internet connection, then syncs
      if there is internet connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      besides that, i plan to dogfood the app for a bit and see what i end up
      wanting. i might make the notes markdown. i might add a search feature. i
      might add ways to export and import notes as plaintext.
