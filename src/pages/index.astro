    <h2>why</h2>
    <p>
      i wanted a simpler notes solution that was tailored to my personal
      workflow.
    </p>

    <h2>demo</h2>
    <div class="demo-container">
      <App client:load demo={true} />
    </div>

    <h2>plans</h2>
    <p>
      a feature i really want is cross-device sync. unfortunately, this will
      require some kind of account based auth stuff. maybe i'll do something
      custom, or maybe i'll just use something like github gists to store notes.
      not sure how i'll do this yet, but i definitely want the app to be
      offline-first so it works even without an internet connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      besides that, i plan to dogfood the app for a bit and see what i end up
      wanting. i might make the notes markdown. i might add a search feature. i
      might add ways to export and import notes as plaintext.
